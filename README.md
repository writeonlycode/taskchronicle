## Technical Stack

Sure! Here's an itemized list of the tech stack with descriptions of each technology used:

1. **Next.js:** Next.js is a popular and powerful React framework for building
   modern web applications. It provides server-side rendering (SSR), static
   site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering capabilities, offering a
   seamless development experience with improved performance and SEO benefits.

2. **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate):** SWR is a lightweight data-fetching library
   for React applications. It helps in managing and caching data from the
   server efficiently, providing a responsive user experience by revalidating
   stale data in the background when needed. SWR integrates seamlessly with
   Next.js, making it an excellent choice for fetching and managing data in the
   application.

3. **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows
   developers to build efficient and responsive user interfaces rapidly. It
   provides a collection of pre-built utility classes that can be easily
   combined to style HTML elements, making it highly customizable and
   straightforward to maintain.

4. **ChadCN UI:** ChadCN UI is a collection of reusable components built using
   Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It offers developers a set of ready-to-use
   components that can be copied and pasted directly into their projects. With
   ChadCN UI, you can leverage the power of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS to create
   consistent and visually appealing user interfaces.

5. **Supabase:** Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS)
   platform that provides a set of tools and APIs for building serverless
   applications quickly. It combines features like database management
   (PostgreSQL), authentication, and real-time subscriptions, making it an
   excellent choice for powering the backend of your application.

**Development Timeline:**

1. [ ] **Week 1: Project Setup and User Authentication**: Set up the Next.js
   project and integrate Tailwind CSS for styling. Implement user registration,
   login, and forgot password functionality using Supabase for authentication.

2. [ ] **Week 2: Time Entry and Timer Feature:** Create interfaces for manual
   time entry, allowing users to log hours for different activities. Implement
   a timer feature to allow users to track time actively as they work on tasks.

3. [ ] **Week 3: Project and Task Management:** Design and develop project
   creation and task assignment features. Users should be able to organize
   their time effectively by defining tasks under each project.

4. [ ] **Week 4: Pomodoro Timer:** Integrate a Pomodoro timer functionality
   into the application. Allow users to set work and break durations for their
   Pomodoro sessions.

5. [ ] **Week 5: Time Summary and Basic Reports** Build a user interface to
   display time summaries for each project and task. Implement basic reports
   like weekly or monthly time breakdowns for users to analyze their
   productivity.

6. [ ] **Week 6: Dashboard and Profile Settings** Develop a personalized
   dashboard to provide users with an overview of their logged hours, active
   projects, and Pomodoro sessions.  Implement profile settings to allow users
   to update their information.
